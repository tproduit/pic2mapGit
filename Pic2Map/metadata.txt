about = The plugin requires qt opengl python support (on Debian and derivates: python-qt4-gl). Pic2map is a so called monoplotting tool. It allows photogrammetric tools to be used in a single photography. Compare to a usual photogrammetric, it has the feature of using a single photographie. The 3D information comes from a digital elevation model. The workflow is divided in three main steps. At the beginning, data are chosen and loaded. Then the pose of the camera with respect to the DEM must be found. This is done with help of control points or in a virtual 3D environment. In the final step, the so called monoplotter is available. Visualisation of vector layers in the photography is enabled. Measurement of 3D lines directly in the photography can be also done. An orthorectification process is running with help of graphical library, wich provide a fine result which take into account the heterogeneity of information in the picture.
